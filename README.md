# ðŸ¦€ Rust Tutorials
Welcome to a repository of my exploration of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), using the **"The Rust Programming Language"** tutorial book! This repo is partially for my convenience, but feel free to take a look and see where I've gotten in the tutorial!

My hope is to get to a point where I can start creating tools with Rust. I was largely inspired to begin learning Rust due to its speed and memory safety (the minimization of trade-offs in these fronts), though the real push was seeing amazing CLI tools, namely many enhancements of existing UNIX commands.

In the future, when I am to make software in Rust, I will link the respective software here, as a tribute to my progress. Notice I said *when*, not *if*-- I have big aspirations! :)
