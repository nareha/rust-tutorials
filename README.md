# ðŸ¦€ Rust Tutorials
Welcome to a repository of my exploration of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), using the **"The Rust Programming Language"** tutorial book! This repo is partially for my convenience, but feel free to take a look and see where I've gotten in the tutorial.
- I have also found the [Rust Book Experiment](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html) to be an interesting way to digest the material.
- I am also following the [UCLA ACM Rustlings](https://github.com/uclaacm/uclaacm-rustlings) resource for additional projects and learning guidance.

My hope is to get to a point where I can start creating tools with Rust. I was largely inspired to begin learning Rust due to its speed and memory safety (the minimization of trade-offs in these fronts), though the real push was seeing amazing CLI tools, namely many enhancements of existing UNIX commands.
